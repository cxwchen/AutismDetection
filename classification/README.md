# Clasification
This folder contains all files used by the Classification subgroup.
It is split into 2 folders: `src` and `GUI`.

`src` contains all files used to implement and evaluate our models.

`GUI` contains all files to develop our tool NASDA (Neuroimaging Autism Spectrum Discorder Analyser).
